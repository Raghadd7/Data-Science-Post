Student must have a Github repository of their project. 

The repository must have a README.md file that: 
1) communicates the libraries used, 
2) the motivation for the project, 
3) the files in the repository with a small description of each, 
4) a summary of the results of the analysis, 
5) and necessary acknowledgements. 

Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.
