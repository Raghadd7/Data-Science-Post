# Data Science Post

Student must have a Github repository of their project. 

The repository must have a README.md file that: 
1) communicates the libraries used, 
2) the motivation for the project, 
3) the files in the repository with a small description of each, 
4) a summary of the results of the analysis, 
5) and necessary acknowledgements. 

Students should not use another student's code to complete the project, but they may use other references on the web including StackOverflow and Kaggle to complete the project.

Catchy image followed by a catchy title.

Write in small blocks of text, as large blocks of text will exhaust and demotivate your reader.

Start with an engaging question or current event that your audience is likely thinking about.

End with a recap and a call to action.
